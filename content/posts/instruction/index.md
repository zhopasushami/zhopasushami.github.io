## Yoki is Not Calming Down
1. Check if Yoki needs to go to the toilet.
2. If not, place her in the crate and secure it.

## Yoki is Whining Loudly in the Crate
1. Check if Yoki might need to go to the toilet.
2. If not, place her in the crate, sit beside her, wait for three seconds of silence, give her a treat, and calm her with a gentle voice.

## Yoki is Not Falling Asleep at Night
- Remove toys and stimuli, wait. If necessary, put her in the crate.

---

## Outside Behavior

### Yoki Jumps and Tries to Bite
- This is a sign of extreme frustration. Stop it immediately. Step on the leash to control her and wait. After 10 seconds of calm, give her a treat.

### Yoki Pulls in All Directions
- **Option 1:** Give more leash, as she becomes stressed if on a short leash for too long.
- **Option 2:** If this doesn’t help, stop moving until she returns to you, then reward her with a treat.
- **Option 3:** If she’s overly excited, distract her with a toy, play briefly ("Kuss" or "Daj" commands), then slow the game down and end with a closing signal.

## Important Notes

1. **Stealing and Destroying:** Yoki likes to steal and destroy objects, including clothing (e.g., socks). Avoid leaving items unattended.
2. **Crate:** Yoki is used to the crate. If she needs to calm down, she can be placed in it. As the "crate" command isn’t fully reliable, gently guide her by the collar and calm her with treats if needed. This is especially useful in new surroundings when she struggles to settle.
3. **Chewing:** Yoki enjoys chewing. To prevent her from chewing on forbidden items, provide 2-3 chew items per day.
4. **Couch:** Yoki is not allowed on the couch but may try repeatedly.
5. **Starting Play:** Humans initiate play. She will bring toys and prompt you to play—please don’t engage, as she uses this to manipulate.
6. **Sleeping:** Yoki prefers to sleep on the floor, where it’s cool, and where she can see us. Usually, she sleeps in the hallway outside our bedroom or on her sleeping spot by our bed when we’re away. She’s not allowed on the bed but may try. Use the crate if needed.
7. **Interactions with Other Dogs:** Avoid prolonged contact with other dogs (limit play to 2 minutes) as she becomes difficult to calm down afterward.

## Cleanliness

Yoki’s bladder control depends on her activity level and water intake:
- **High Activity (e.g., lots of play):** Up to 4 hours.
- **Low Activity (e.g., nighttime):** Currently up to 9-10 hours.

If she needs something (attention, play, food, water, or toilet), she will bark persistently and may jump on you. To avoid confusion, it’s recommended to take her out after 4-5 hours to prevent accidents.

Yoki usually has two to three bowel movements per day (typically morning and evening, after long walks).

## Daily Routine

This routine is a guideline. Yoki is adaptable and accustomed to both long outdoor days and short walks. Ensuring timely bathroom breaks is key.

1. Wake up and prepare calmly for the walk.
2. Morning walk (treats if needed).
3. Feeding.
4. Quiet play at home (e.g., search games).
5. Rest period with occasional bathroom breaks.
6. Evening walk.
7. Feeding.
8. Cuddles.
9. Short outdoor break before bedtime.
10. Sleep time.

## Helpful Exercises

| Exercise | Procedure | Benefit |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **2 Steps** | Place a treat on the floor, step back two steps. Yoki eats the treat and follows. Place another treat, step back again, repeat at least five times. | Distraction/Calming (e.g., during walks) |
| **Lass es** | Place a treat on your palm, say “Lass es,” hold it near her nose and let her focus on it. After a while, say “Da” to allow her to eat it. | Calming |
| **Back / Long Leash** | If Yoki pulls on a long leash, say “Back” when the leash is taut and wait for her to return to you. Praise her and give a treat when she returns, then continue. | Reduces pulling |
